# TODO
Make it prettier. I want to add some kind of animation or visual representation of the cuurent weather either to the background or to the div that shows the current weather.

Make it possible to track the weather for multiple locations.
Also add either a local storage to remember your last location/locations or load the weather for your current geolocation from your IP adress.
